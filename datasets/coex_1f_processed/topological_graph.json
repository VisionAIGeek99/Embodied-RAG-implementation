Floor (marble)\n\n### Spatial Relationships:\n- The **glass entrance doors** are located at the center of the image, leading into the building.\n- **Pillars** are positioned on either side of the entrance, providing structural support.\n- The **wooden wall** is to the right of the entrance, creating a boundary for the space.\n- The **reception desk** is situated to the left of the entrance, indicating a welcoming area for visitors.\n- **Signage** is hanging above the entrance, providing directional information.\n- The **trash bin** is placed near the reception area, likely for convenience.\n- The **floor** is visible throughout the space, showcasing a marble finish that reflects light and enhances the aesthetic."
